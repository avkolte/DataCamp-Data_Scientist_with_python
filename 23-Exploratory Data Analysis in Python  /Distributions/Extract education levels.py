Extract education levels
Let's create Boolean Series to identify respondents with different levels of education.

In the U.S, 12 years of education usually means the respondent has completed high school (secondary education). A respondent with 14 years of education has probably completed an associate degree (two years of college); someone with 16 years has probably completed a bachelor's degree (four years of college).

# Select educ
educ = gss['educ']

# Bachelor's degree
bach = (educ >= 16)

# Associate degree
assc = (educ >= 14) & (educ < 16)

# High school
high = (educ <= 12)
print(high.mean())
