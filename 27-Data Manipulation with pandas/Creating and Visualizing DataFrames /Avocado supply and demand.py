'''Scatter plots are ideal for visualizing relationships between numerical variables. In this exercise, you'll compare the number of avocados sold to average price and see if they're at all related. If they're related, you may be able to use one number to predict the other.

matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt and pandas has been imported as pd.'''

avocados[avocados["type"] == "conventional"]["avg_price"].hist()
