'''Previously, you changed the order of the rows in a DataFrame by calling .sort_values(). It's also useful to be able to sort by elements in the index. For this, you need to use .sort_index().

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_ind has a multi-level index of country and city, and is available.'''

# Sort temperatures_ind by index values
print(temperatures_ind.sort_index())

# Sort temperatures_ind by index values at the city level
print(temperatures_ind.sort_index(level="city"))

# Sort temperatures_ind by country then descending city
print(temperatures_ind.sort_index(level=["country", "city"], ascending = [True, False]))
