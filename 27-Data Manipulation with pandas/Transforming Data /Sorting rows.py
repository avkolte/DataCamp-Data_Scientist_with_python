'''Finding interested bits of data in a DataFrame is often easier if you change the order of the rows. You can sort the rows by passing a column name to .sort_values().

In cases where rows have the same value (this is common if you sort on a categorical variable), you may wish to break the ties by sorting on another column. You can sort on multiple columns in this way by passing a list of column names.'''

# Sort homelessness by region, then descending family members
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(["region", "family_members"], ascending=[True, False])

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_reg_fam.head())
