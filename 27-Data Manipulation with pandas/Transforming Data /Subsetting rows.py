'''A large part of data science is about finding which bits of your dataset are interesting. One of the simplest techniques for this is to find a subset of rows that match some criteria. This is sometimes known as filtering rows or selecting rows.

There are many ways to subset a DataFrame, perhaps the most common is to use relational operators to return True or False for each row, then pass that inside square brackets.'''
# Filter for rows where region is Mountain
mountain_reg = homelessness[homelessness["region"] == "Mountain"]

# See the result
print(mountain_reg)

# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness["family_members"] < 1000) & (homelessness["region"] == "Pacific")]

# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)

# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000

fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness["family_members"] < 1000) & (homelessness["region"] == "Pacific")]
