'''After having unified the currencies of your different account amounts, you want to add a temporal dimension to your analysis and see how customers have been investing their money given the size of their account over each year. The account_opened column represents when customers opened their accounts and is a good proxy for segmenting customer activity and investment over time.

However, since this data was consolidated from multiple sources, you need to make sure that all dates are of the same format. You will do so by converting this column into a datetime object, while making sure that the format is inferred and potentially incorrect formats are set to missing. The banking DataFrame is in your environment and pandas was imported as pd.'''
